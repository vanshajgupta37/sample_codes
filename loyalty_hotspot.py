    """
    Solves the Dynamic Loyalty Hotspot problem.

    Problem Description:
    Imagine you're building a feature for a social network. In this network,
    people have friends, and those friendships connect them into groups (you're
    in the same group as your friends, your friends' friends, and so on).
    Every person has a "loyalty score." Your task is to build a system that
    can handle two things very quickly:

    1. update_loyalty: The loyalty score of any person can change at any time.
    2. query_max_loyalty: For any person, you need to find the absolute highest
       loyalty score within their entire friend group.

    Core Challenge:
    The main difficulty is handling updates efficiently. If the person with the
    current highest score gets their loyalty *lowered*, the system must instantly
    find the *new* highest score among everyone else in their group without a

    slow, manual search. This solution uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data
    structure to manage friend groups, where each group maintains a sorted list
    of its members' scores to make finding the maximum instantaneous.
